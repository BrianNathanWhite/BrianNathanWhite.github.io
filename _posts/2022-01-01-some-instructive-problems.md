In this post, for the benefit of my future self and stray readers, I'll go over some problems I found instructive during my first year of course-work at UNC. My goal is to add one new problem per day so check back often!

[Problem 1](/images/problems/p1.pdf)

  Topic: Random matrices, normal, chi-sqaured distributions.
  
[Problem 2](/images/problems/p2.pdf)

  Topic: Jensen's inequality, order statistics, bounds.
