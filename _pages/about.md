I am a biostatistician at the [Wake Forest School of Medicine](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-data-science) with extensive experience in medical prediction modeling using machine learning methods, survival analysis, causal inference, statistical consulting, and spatial epidemiology. In addition, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill, where my research focuses on the analysis of spatial extremes.

### Professional Focus

My professional interests include (in no particular order):

- Statistical consulting
- Spatial extremes
- Hierarchical Bayesian modeling
- Causal inference
- Survival analysis
- Spatial epidemiology
- Medical prediction modeling using machine learning

Through my work, I aim to advance the fields of biostatistics and epidemiology, contributing to improved predictive models and a better understanding of spatial and temporal data.
