I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Statistics & Operations Research at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. Before coming to Chapel Hill I earned an M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

My research interests include: extreme value theory, spatial statistics and statistical machine learning. Currently, I am working with Richard Smith, Rick Luettich and Brian Blanton to develop a spatial extremes model for storm surge events in FEMA-region 4.
