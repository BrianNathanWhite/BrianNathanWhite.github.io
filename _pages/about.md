I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill. Before coming to Chapel Hill I earned an M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

My research interests include extreme value theory, spatial statistics and environmental statistics. In collaboration with the Renaissance Computing Institute [(RENCI)](https://renci.org/) at UNC and [Richard L. Smith](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/richard-smith-phd/), I am devloping a model for the spatio-temporal trends of extreme sea-levels under a variety of climate-change scenarios.

For additional information concerning my education and professional experience see my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 1/1/2022).
