I am a biostatistician at the [Wake Forest School of Medicine](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-data-science) and a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill. Previously, I earned a M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

Generally speaking, I am interested in the development and use of statistical methods for biological/environmental problems.

My doctoral research is concerned with two questions: First, how have sea-level extremes along the Atlantic Coast varied over space and time? Second, how will these patterns evolve under different climate change scenarios? To answer these questions, I've been developing a statistical model using tools from extreme value theory, spatial statistics, and oceanography. 

For additional information concerning my education and professional experience see my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 5/1/2022).

These days, when I'm not doing research, you can find me walking my dog Roo, playing piano or bouldering!
