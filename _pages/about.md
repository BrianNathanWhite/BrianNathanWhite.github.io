I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics & Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill. Before coming to Chapel Hill I earned an M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

My research interests include extreme value theory, spatial statistics and statistical machine learning. At the moment, I am developing a spatial extremes model for storm surge events in the Eastern Seaboard with my advisor, Richard L. Smith, in collaboration with the Renaissance Computing Institute [(RENCI)](https://renci.org/) at UNC.

For additional information concerning my education and professional experience see my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 1/1/2022).
