I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill. Before coming to Chapel Hill I earned an M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

My research interests include extreme value theory, spatial statistics and environmental statistics.

For additional information concerning my education and professional experience see my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 1/1/2022).

These days, when I'm not doing research, you can find me walking my dog Roo, playing piano or bouldering!
