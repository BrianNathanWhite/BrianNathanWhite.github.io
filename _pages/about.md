I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Statistics & Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My current work involves the development of novel methods in spatial statistics and extreme value theory, with applications to the modeling of storm-surge events on the Eastern Seaboard. I earned my M.A. in Mathematical Statistics from Wake Forest University and my B.S. in Environmental Studies from the University of North Carolina at Asheville.

Here is a copy of my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 12/14/2021).
