I am a biostatistician at the [Wake Forest School of Medicine](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/biostatistics-and-data-science) and a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill. Previously, I earned a M.A. in Mathematical Statistics at Wake Forest Universty and a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UNC Asheville.

These days, when I'm not doing research, you can find me walking my dog Roo, playing piano or bouldering!

For additional information concerning my education and professional experience see my [resume](/resume.pdf) (last updated 5/1/2022).
