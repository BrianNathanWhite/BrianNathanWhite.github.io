## Dissertation ##

I conduct methodological research at the intersection of spatial statistics, extreme value theory and data assimilation.

## Medical Research ##

Currently, my work in the Wake Forest School of Medicine falls into three categories:

### 1. Statistical Consulting ###

---

I provide study design advice, grant development services and statistical analysis for medical professionals across the Wake Forest School of Medicine and Atrium Health medical system.

### 2. Spatial Epidemiology ###

---

I work with Dave Kline & Staci Hepler to develop and implement high-dimensional Bayesian hierarchical models of the opioid epidemic in co-operation with public health officials and medical experts.

</div>

### 3. Clinical Trials ###

---

I analyze data generated by the **LEAP** (Long-Term Effectiveness of Anti-Obesity Medication Phentermine) clinical trial, which is supported by the National Institutes of Health. This randomized, multi-site, double-blind study explores the effectiveness and safety of the anti-obesity drug phentermine over a long-term period.
