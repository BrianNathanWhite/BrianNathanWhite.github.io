Generally speaking, I am interested in the development and use of statistical methods for biological/environmental problems.

My doctoral research is concerned with two questions: First, how have sea-level extremes along the Atlantic Coast varied over space and time? Second, how will these patterns evolve under different climate change scenarios? To answer these questions, Iâ€™ve been developing a statistical model using tools from extreme value theory, spatial statistics, and oceanography.
 
This work is in collaboration with the Renaissance Computing Institute [(RENCI)](https://renci.org/) at UNC and my research advisor [Richard L. Smith](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/richard-smith-phd/.).

A recent presentation on my work modeling the spatial extremes of coastal (U.S. East) sea-level time-series:
