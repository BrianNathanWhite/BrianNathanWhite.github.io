## Dissertation ##

My dissertation is centered on spatial extremes and concerns the following topics:

1. *Combining Observational and Model Data for Spatial Extremes Through a Multivariate Gaussian Latent Process*
2. *Forecasting Spatial Extremes Using Climatic Covariates*
3. *Vecchia Approximation for Spatial Extremes*

## OpenLong Project ##

In addition to my dissertation work, I develop **OpenLong**, an open-source R package that harmonizes commonly used longitudinal data sets on aging. OpenLong facilitates machine learning benchmark studies, prediction modeling, and meta-analyses, enabling researchers to perform more efficient and accurate analyses.
