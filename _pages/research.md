## Dissertation ##

I conduct methodological research at the intersection of spatial statistics, extreme value theory and data assimilation. My dissertation work is composed of three parts:

1. *Combining Observational and Model Data for Spatial Extremes Through a Multivariate Latent Gaussian Process*

   Developed a multivariate latent Gaussian process to integrate observational and model data, enhancing the accuracy of return level estimates.
   
2. *Forecasting Spatial Extremes Using Climatic Covariates* 

   Utilized climatic covariates to forecast models for spatial extremes under a range of climate change scenarios.
   
3. *Vecchia Approximation for Spatial Extremes*

   Applied Vecchia approximations to spatial extreme value models, significantly reducing the computational costs associated with large spatial data sets, while maintaining model accuracy.

## Medical Research ##

Currently, my work in the Wake Forest School of Medicine falls into three categories:

### 1. Statistical Consulting ###

---

I provide study design advice, grant development services and statistical analysis for medical professionals across the Wake Forest School of Medicine and Atrium Health medical system.

### 2. Spatial Epidemiology ###

---

I work with Dave Kline & Staci Hepler to develop and implement high-dimensional Bayesian hierarchical models of the opioid epidemic in co-operation with public health officials and medical experts.

### 3. OpenLong Project ###

---

I work with Jaime Speiser & Byron Yaeger to develop **OpenLong**, an open-source R package that harmonizes commonly used longitudinal data sets on aging. **OpenLong** facilitates machine learning benchmark studies, prediction modeling, and meta-analyses, enabling researchers to perform more efficient and accurate analyses.
