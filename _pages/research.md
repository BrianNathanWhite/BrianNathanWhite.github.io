At a high-level, my current work involves the development and use of statistical models to infer long term spatio-temporal trends in environmental extremes (e.g. heat waves, sea surges) under different climate-change scenarios. This work is in collaboration with the Renaissance Computing Institute [(RENCI)](https://renci.org/) at UNC and my research advisor [Richard L. Smith](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/richard-smith-phd/.).
